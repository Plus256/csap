An Online Chat Application.
<h1>Note</h1>
<p>
Guys! Please don't run pentests on my website (<a href="http://plus256.com">plus256.com</a>) - it is not secure! I used it to host this assignment, because I had no time to setup a VPS. I hope you understand :D

<h4>Server</h4>
<p>This app depends on a PHP library by Abraham Williams to implement the Twitter OAuth REST API. Check out project on <a href="https://github.com/abraham/twitteroauth">GitHub</a></p>
<p>The library only supports PHP v5.6 and v7.0 so I had to upgrade from v5.4 to v5.6 (the latest available on my Godaddy Shared Hosting Account). At this point I thought of migrating to a VPS :D</p>
